## scoring block
Scoring calibration:
Score ≥ 0.80 ONLY if the item clearly involves modern computational science developments including scientific machine learning.

If it is primarily about machine learning without an application in computational science and engineering,
  cap score at 0.40.

If it is primarily theoretical work without an applied computational component,
  cap score at 0.25. -->

## narrative
My work centers on scientific computing and high‑performance methods for simulating complex physical systems, especially in fluid dynamics and biomolecular electrostatics. I have made contributions to meshless vortex methods, fast multipole algorithms, and GPU‑accelerated solvers that enable large‑scale simulations such as turbulence, N‑body interactions, and protein–surface electrostatics. 

A major strand of my research and community leadership focuses on reproducible and replicable computational science, including terminology, taxonomies, workflows, and policy for open source software and trustworthy computational evidence. In parallel, I am active in engineering education and pedagogy, developing open learning resources with Python and Jupyter, writing about computational thinking, and exploring the role of generative AI and new assessment designs in engineering curricula.
