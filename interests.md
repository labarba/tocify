## Narrative
My research pushes the boundaries of extreme-environment physics through a dual-track approach: the specialized development of high-fidelity Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation frameworks and the creation of agentic R&D pipelines for rapid scientific discovery. As the primary architect of `pyfdMHD`, I focus on the intricate numerical modeling of applied-field Magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters, where I derive and implement advanced solvers for non-ideal MHD effects, focusing on Lenz braking, back-EMF, and structural multi-physics coupling. I am deeply interested in computational electromagnetics, hypersonics, and the non-linear dynamics of high-energy plasmas, aiming to translate complex theoretical formulations into robust numerical outputs that drive the next generation of spacecraft propulsion and satellite technology.

A critical pillar of my work is "R&D Acceleration"—the use of distributed AI agents and agentic workflows to bypass traditional bottlenecks in the scientific process. This includes building autonomous systems using frameworks like LangGraph, Ollama, and specialized physics-informed LLMs to manage automated mesh generation, iteratively refine simulation parameters (such as SOR relaxation factors), and orchestrate massive multi-physics modeling tasks. I explore how AI agents can serve as strategic R&D partners for scientific computing, technical analysis, and rapid engineering optimization, particularly in the aerospace and defense sectors.

I prioritize research that bridges the gap between pure physics and applied engineering, focusing on:
- **Numerical Innovation**: Novel PDE solvers, body-fitted grids, and Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) including Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators.
- **Multiphysics Integration**: Structural-fluid-plasma interactions and high-performance computing (HPC) workflows for real-time physics simulation.
- **Agentic Infrastructure**: Autonomous research agents, distributed agent swarms for mission control, and natural language interfaces for scientific computing.
- **Technical Strategy**: Using AI for competitive intelligence, grant analysis, and "Quant" style analysis of the global aerospace R&D landscape.

I am not interested in general-purpose NLP or CV unless it is explicitly and technical applied to the physical sciences, PDE solving, or specialized engineering R&D. I seek papers with technical depth that provide actionable insights for accelerating technical R&D and mastering the physics of extreme environments.
