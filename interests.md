## narrative
My research focuses on the computational modeling and simulation of high-energy plasma environments, with a specific emphasis on Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and its application to advanced aerospace propulsion systems. I am the primary developer of `pyfdMHD`, a Python-based simulation framework designed for modeling applied-field Magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters. My work involves deriving complex theoretical formulations and implementing numerical methods, such as body-fitted grids and iterative solvers like Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR), to capture intricate plasma behaviors and braking effects.

A central theme of my work is the integration of advanced computing paradigms into the scientific workflow. This includes the development of autonomous AI agents and agentic workflows (utilizing frameworks like LangGraph and local LLMs via Ollama) to automate data analysis, refine simulation parameters, and manage complex multi-physics modeling tasks. I am particularly interested in how LLMs and "agentic" systems can be leveraged to accelerate R&D in the aerospace sector, specifically for satellite technology and hypersonic flight.

I study the intersection of plasma dynamics and structural multi-physics, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical derivations and high-fidelity numerical output. My interest extends to the use of AI for "Quant" style financial and technical analysis within the aerospace and defense industry, focusing on companies that utilize AI to drive rapid hardware iteration. I prioritize research that introduces novel numerical schemes for plasma PDEs, advances in physics-informed machine learning, and the deployment of AI agents for scientific discovery and engineering optimization.

I am generally not interested in general-purpose AI/ML unless it directly applies to scientific computing, PDE solving, or specialized aerospace R&D workflows.
