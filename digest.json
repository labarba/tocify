  "notes": "Two papers on tensor-network-accelerated Vlasov-Poisson and structure-preserving discrete-gradient methods scored highest, targeting computational efficiency in kinetic plasma simulation. Five additional papers address MHD instabilities, moment models, and warm dense matter—all relevant to plasma physics fundamentals, but none directly target applied-field MPD thrusters, non-ideal MHD effects, or agentic R&D workflows. Remaining batch skews toward quantum chemistry, molecular kinetics, and materials processing with minimal direct relevance. One paper on aerospace optimal control and one on lattice Boltzmann multiphase flow methods show modest relevance to computational methods. Multiple papers on LLM agents and agentic workflows (reasoning adaptation, trajectory optimization, skill benchmarking) align with the R&D acceleration pillar, though none explicitly address scientific discovery in plasma or MHD contexts. One paper stands out: \"Perceptual Self-Reflection in Agentic Physics Simulation Code Generation\" (0.88) directly targets agentic automation for physics code—core to R&D acceleration. Secondary themes include CUDA optimization (0.72) for HPC infrastructure and modular agent architectures (0.70) for scientific workflow design. Most remaining papers focus on RL, LLM evaluation, or business applications disconnected from MHD, plasma, or aerospace research. Two papers demonstrate strong PINN-based computational approaches and RL-driven design automation in physical systems",
