<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>The brain can be conceptualized as a control system facilitating transitions between states, such as from rest to motor activity. Applying network control theory to measurements of brain signals enables characterization of brain dynamics through control properties. However, most prior studies that have applied network control theory have evaluated brain dynamics under unperturbed conditions, neglecting the critical role of external perturbations in accurate system identification. In this stud…

## [Synapse-specific and plasticity-regulated AMPA receptor mobility tunes synaptic integration](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00931-6?rss=yes)
*Neuron*  
Score: **0.80**  
Published: 2026-02-04T00:00:00+00:00
Tags: synaptic, timescales, neural dynamics

Discusses AMPAR mobility and synaptic plasticity, linked to rapid timescales and information processing.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Short-term plasticity (STP) filters synaptic inputs across rapid timescales. Nowacka et al. show that postsynaptic AMPAR desensitization and diffusion-trapping, shaped by auxiliary subunits and activity-dependent signaling, generate synapse-specific gain control. By broadening temporal filtering and adjusting short-term depression, receptor mobility emerges as a central regulator of circuit information processing.

## [Identification of an engram ensemble mediating memory forgetting in the dentate gyrus](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00987-0?rss=yes)
*Neuron*  
Score: **0.70**

Tags: neuronal ensembles, memory, dentate gyrus

Study focuses on neuronal ensembles and signaling pathways, relevant to interests in electrophysiology and neural dynamics.

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Hu et al. show that the dentate gyrus engram comprises two neuronal ensembles: one supports remembering, and the other promotes forgetting. By shifting the balance between these ensembles via Rac1 signaling, the brain flexibly controls recall. Dysfunctions of the forgetting ensemble contribute to memory abnormalities in models of Alzheimer’s disease and autism.

## [The Spatial Coding of Touch Is Defined in Intrinsic, Limb-Specific Coordinates: An EEG Study](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/46/5/e1089252025?rss=1)
*J Neurosci*  
Score: **0.60**

Tags: EEG, sensory coding, neurophysiology

Involves EEG and touches on sensory coding, a computational perspective on sensory processing.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>The brain computes the spatiotopic position of touch by integrating tactile and proprioceptive signals (i.e., tactile remapping). While it is often assumed that the spatiotopic touch location is mapped into extrinsic, limb-independent coordinates, an alternative view proposes that touch is remapped into intrinsic, limb-specific coordinates. To test between these hypotheses, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and a novel tactile stimulation paradigm in which participants (<i>N</i> = 20, 19 f…

Tags: dopamine, electrophysiology, neural pathways

Exploration decisions via dopaminergic pathways converge on electrophysiological dynamics, relevant to neural computations.

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Using mouse models, Zheng et al. show that social engagement promotes both innate and experience-dependent exploration. Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) encode risk assessment and exploratory motivation through firing pattern-biased DA transmission, thereby shaping exploration decisions via competing VTADA pathways that converge onto basolateral amygdala neurons.

## [Hippocampal estrogen levels, receptor types, and epigenetics contribute to sex-specific memory vulnerabilities to concurrent acute stresses](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00993-6?rss=yes)
*Neuron*  
Score: **0.50**  
Published: 2026-02-03T00:00:00+00:00
Tags: hippocampus, memory, stress

Focus on memory dynamics and stress responses relates to neural signaling, although not directly central to electrophysiology or computational modeling.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Acute concurrent stresses provoke lasting, sex-dependent memory problems. Hokenson, Rodríguez-Acevedo, et al. find that high hippocampal estrogen levels in mice generate permissive chromatin states, allowing both adaptive plasticity and vulnerability to acute concurrent stresses. Stress vulnerability involves estrogen receptor (ER)α in males and ERβ in females.
