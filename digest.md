# Weekly ToC Digest (week of 2026-02-10)

> This week's digest spans a rich landscape of plasma physics, computational methods, and physics-informed machine learning. The batch is dominated by solid contributions in plasma simulation, gyrokinetic turbulence, and MHD stability—areas closely aligned with your core interests. We've also identified several strong numerical methods papers (tensor-train solvers, AMR schemes, differentiable programming) that bridge classical simulation with modern ML acceleration, plus a few standout papers on physics-informed neural networks and symbolic regression that reflect growing momentum at the intersection of scientific computing and AI agents. While the volume of general-purpose papers (NLP benchmarks, molecular ML) is notable, the true highlights here are the plasma codes, multi-physics simulations, and computationally-grounded scientific workflows. This week's batch is dominated by AI agent frameworks and LLM-driven scientific workflows—a strong thematic alignment with your interest in agentic systems for research and engineering optimization. While the selection skews heavily toward general-purpose AI and NLP, we've identified several papers with genuine scientific computing applications, particularly around multi-agent reasoning for materials discovery and autonomous scientific optimization. The batch also includes some emerging work on LLM-based reasoning for mathematical and technical problems. Unfortunately, there are no new plasma simulations, MHD numerical methods, or space
