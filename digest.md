<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Bad channels in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings can substantially degrade downstream analyses, particularly in high-density datasets where localized hardware or motion-related artifacts may affect groups of electrodes in a structured manner. We introduce a MATLAB Module for bad-channel quality control that emphasizes interpretability, relational structure, and human-in-the-loop validation rather than fully automated rejection. The method operates on multi-channel EEG data and combines co…

## [MV-ComBat and MV-CovBat: Multivariate Frameworks for Joint Harmonization of Multi-Metric Neuroimaging Data](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.05.704069v1?rss=1)
*bioRxiv*

Relevant due to focus on computational frameworks for harmonization across multiple metrics, which aligns with interests in data science methods and physiological signal processing.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Aggregating neuroimaging data across sites and studies is increasingly common, yet site- and scanner-related batch effects can obscure meaningful biological variation and introduce spurious associations. Although ComBat and its extensions are widely used, they are primarily designed for single-metric (univariate) harmonization. In practice, neuroimaging studies often involve multiple biologically coupled metrics (e.g., cortical thickness, surface area, and gray-matter volume) measured across mul…

## [Use-dependent regulation of the axonal action potential in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.07.704588v1?rss=1)

Tags: neuronal timescales, neuronal dynamics, electrophysiology

Focuses on neuronal computation and electrophysiology with axonal AP propagation which aligns with neuronal timescales and dynamics.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

The action potential (AP) is thought to be generated at the axon initial segment and to faithfully propagate along the axon. However, data from both invertebrate and mammalian systems show that the axon is an underappreciated locus of activity modulation and neuronal computation. We assessed axonal AP propagation in neocortical parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs) during prolonged, high-frequency activity through paired whole-cell somatic and axon-attached patch clamp recordings in acute…

Fenstermacher et al. map the structure and activity of spinal-projecting serotonergic neurons and show that 5-HT populations are engaged in a context-dependent manner during locomotion. Activation of ventrally projecting 5-HT neurons enhances the speed and endurance of ongoing locomotion, revealing serotonergic neurons can potentiate motor output over extended time scales.

Discusses activity-dependent plasticity in neural circuits, relevant to neuronal timescales and electrophysiology.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Neural circuits are remarkably robust to perturbations that threaten their function. Activity-dependent homeostatic plasticity (ADHP) is a stabilizing mechanism that supports robustness by tuning neuronal ion conductances to combat chronic over- or under-activity. Its restorative capacity has been demonstrated in the pyloric circuit of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, whose neurons must burst in a specific order to coordinate digestive muscles. After disruption by physical and pharmacolog…

Neuronal energy regulation is increasingly recognized as a critical factor underlying brain functions and their pathological alterations, yet the metabolic dynamics that accompany cognitive processes remain poorly understood. As a label-free and minimally invasive technique, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of coenzymes NADH and NADPH (collectively referred to as NAD(P)H) offers the possibility to resolve cellular metabolic profiles with high spatial precision. However, NAD(P)H FLIM’s capaci…

The signaling pathways that control embryonic development, migration, and differentiation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, as well as the postnatal fate, function, and survival of differentiated cells, are the subject of ongoing research. Here, we examined the role of phosphoinositides in this complex multistep process by generating GnRH neuron-specific phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase alpha knockout mice. These mice were healthy and indistinguishable from their control littermates…
